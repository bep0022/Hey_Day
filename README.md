# Hey_Day
The Hey Day tradition at Auburn University started to make students that were WWII veterans feel more welcome upon their return to campus. The tradition has continued every year since. Everyone wears name tags and greet each with an enthusiatic "Hey" on Hey Day.

This script was created with the intention of customizably saying "Hey" to people.
The script asks the user for their name input, reads it and outputs a personal Hey Day message.
